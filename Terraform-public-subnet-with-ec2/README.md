# Project Description
This project demonstrates the implementation of a highly available, scalable web infrastructure on AWS using Terraform. The architecture includes the setup of a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with public subnets, an Internet Gateway for external access, an Application Load Balancer for efficient traffic distribution, and Ubuntu EC2 instances deployed in high-availability mode across multiple Availability Zones.

With this setup, the project ensures fault tolerance, reliability, and scalability, making it suitable for production-grade applications. The infrastructure is managed using Terraform, allowing for easy replication, modification, and version control of the infrastructure code.

## Key features of the project:

Scalable Web Infrastructure: Deployed in a multi-AZ setup for high availability.
Automated Infrastructure Management: Managed using Terraform for streamlined provisioning and updates.
Fault-Tolerant Design: Ensures reliability and uptime even during failures.
